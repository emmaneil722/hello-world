# hello-world
I'm a junior at Williams College with quite a different story from the last time I completed this exercise. I'm still from Cleveland, Ohio, a city which I love and adamantly believe is "on the up-and-up". I still love listening to music (especially hip hop, R&B, and soul) as well as cooking and sharing love through food. I took a year off of college to wait out the pandemic and ended up moving to Berlin, getting much closer to my oldest brother Thomas, and navigating a remote software development internship... in German! It's good to be back at Williams, learning and struggling and growing :)
