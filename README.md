# hello-world
a repository for ideas and thoughts
I'm a freshman at Williams College, but originally I'm from Cleveland, Ohio, a city which I love and adamantly believe is "on the up-and-up". I love listening to music (especially hip hop, R&B, and soul, but also folk and classical). I also love food and cooking with friends. I'm half-french and grew up bilingual.
